|PLATFORM|: 
    ⚬ macOS, VS CODE


|COMPILE DIRECTIONS|:
    ⚬ Use the provided makeFile to compile program
        ⚬ Executable name: run

|RUN PROGRAM DIRECTIONS|:
    ⚬ Must include an input file on command line

|BUGS|:
    ⚬ Not a bug, but my program does not indent on WHILE
    ⚬ Program can reread successful beautify code. However that does not mean all grammar are correct.
        ⚬ I believe I tested all the grammars, but there exists cases I might of missed.


|SOLUTION APPROACH|:
    ⚬ Create Grammar hpp and cpp file
    ⚬ Reuse lexical analayzer from my project 1
    ⚬ Work bottom up on the grammar list
    ⚬ Run program
    ⚬ Rewrite each grammar (ungetting at wrong place)
    ⚬ Beautify code by keeping track of number of indentations

    1/29:
        ⚬ Review in class code
        ⚬ Understand handout
        ⚬ Import Project 1 Codes
        ⚬ Creating Grammar.hpp
            ⚬ Finish writing grammar defintion
        ⚬ Working on "factor"
            ⚬ Modifying MakeFile
            ⚬ Seems like "factor" works

    1/31
        ⚬ Changing all grammar defintions to return bool rather than strings
            ⚬ Easier to indicate if parsar was successful or not 
        ⚬ Working on Program again
        ⚬ Need to get SEMICOLON to work
           ⚬ Investigating     idlist
        ⚬ Main should only pass in the token and the input file. It should not read the first token!!
        ⚬ Work on compound again

        
    2/1
        ⚬ Revisting    exprlist
            ⚬ should work now...
        ⚬ Revisiting   expr
            ⚬ should work now...
        ⚬ Revisting    stmt
            ⚬ still need to finish     ID | ID LPAREN exprlist RPAREN
            ⚬ working on -> IF
                ⚬ should work now...
            ⚬ working on -> WHILE
                ⚬ should work now...
            ⚬ working on -> compound
                ⚬ should work now..,
            ⚬ working on -> ID

        ⚬ Need to revist simpexpr
            ⚬ should work now...
        ⚬ Working on   term

    2/2:
        ⚬ I must be ungetting the token in the wrong places!
            ⚬ Go through each grammar again
                ⚬ was ungetting tokens at wrong places >:(
            ⚬ It works now!!

        ⚬ Need to beautify code

        ⚬ When to tab:
            ⚬ After BEGIN, IF, ELSE
        
    2/5:
        ⚬ Keep a tab counter

        PLAN
            ⚬ Increment when it encounters (print token then increment counter)
                ⚬ BEGIN
                ⚬ IF
                ⚬ ELSE

            ⚬ Decrement when it encounters (decrement then print)
                ⚬ END

        ⚬ Working on incrementing tabs
            ⚬ still working on it
            ⚬ off by one 
            ⚬ need to address c = c - b
                ⚬ done!
            ⚬ it works!!!

        ⚬ Working on decrementing tabs
            ⚬ need to address "end"
                ⚬ fixed
            ⚬ need to address "end;"
            ⚬ done!

        ⚬ TMR: clean/finalize code

    2/6:
        ⚬ Need to fix space issues

    2/7: 
        ⚬ Cleaning code and finalizing project
