|PLATFORM|: 
   ⚬ macOS, VS CODE


|COMPILE DIRECTIONS|:
    ⚬ Compile program with provided make file. 
        Executable name: run


|RUN PROGRAM DIRECTIONS|:
    ⚬ Specify an input file in the command line


|BUGS|:
    ⚬ No apparent/known bugs, but that does not gaurentee it will work for all cases.


|SOLUTION APPROACH|:
    ⚬ Create DFA table
    ⚬ Initialize DFA table
    ⚬ "Map" the provided graph in our DFA table
    ⚬ Run program with provided test case
    ⚬ Handle comments
    ⚬ Handle reserved key words
    ⚬ Create and test with my own test case

    1/13:
        ⚬ Understand handout
        ⚬ Create an DFA table

            Question: 
                    ⚬ What is the table size?
                        There are 20 states...
                    ⚬ What is the enum for the "start" state?

        ⚬ Mapped out the simple transitions: COMMA, RBRACK, LBRACK, SEMICOLON, RPAREN, LPAREN

        ⚬ Attempted to mapped the "2nd layer transitions": RELOP, ASSIGNOP, NUM_INT, NUM_REAL

        ⚬ Not sure what to do with MULOP, ADDOP 

        ⚬ Mapped out OR & AND

            Question: How to map out the alphabets?

        ⚬ Wait until next class period for more information


    1/16:
        ⚬ Working on skipping white spaces
            ⚬ Will need to work on skipping comments "#"
        ⚬ Working on mapping ALPHA lowercase (DONE)
            ⚬ ... and uppercase (DONE)
    
    1/17:
        ⚬ Should not use enum values because it does not align to the graph
            ⚬ Just going to use the integer values on the graph 
            ⚬ (DONE)

        ⚬ Need to figure out how to assign the private variable _type to type TokenType

    1/18:
        ⚬ Create a helper function that returns the corresponding TokenType values
        ⚬ Need to handle comments #
            ⚬ Wrote a function that determines if current character is a commment
            ⚬ (DONE) Can handle comments!
        ⚬ Need to fix line number when comments are encountered (DONE)
        ⚬ Need to stop the program if we reach the end of the file (DONE)
        ⚬ Need to check if valid ID is a reserved word (DONE)
            ⚬ Create a function that returns the corresponding TokenType
            ⚬ (DONE)
        ⚬ Making my own test case 

    1/19:
        ⚬ Program cannot handle &&&, |||, &, |
            ⚬ Forgot to return ERROR if the current state is not a final state -_-
        ⚬ Convinced myself with my hard test case
        ⚬ Cleaning up code
