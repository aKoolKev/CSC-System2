    1/13:
        ⚬ Understand handout
        ⚬ Create an empty DFA table if it does not already exists

            ??? What is the size of our table?
            There are 20 states...16 of which are final states 

            ??? What is the enum of the start state

        ⚬ Mapped out the simple transitions: COMMA, RBRACK, LBRACK, SEMICOLON, RPAREN, LPAREN

        ⚬ Attempted to mapped the "2nd layer transitions": RELOP, ASSIGNOP, NUM_INT, NUM_REAL

        ⚬ Not sure what to do with MULOP, ADDOP 

        ⚬ Mapped out OR & AND

            ??? How to map out the alphabets

        ⚬ Wait until next class period for more information
